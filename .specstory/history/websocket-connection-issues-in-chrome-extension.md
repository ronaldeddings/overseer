## WebSocket Connection Issues in Chrome Extension (2/2/2025, 10:59:27 AM)

Please review @README.md to get familiar with my project.... I'm having issues with my websocket from chrome extension to my server... It should establish a single websocket connection and there should be heartbeats sent to keep the connection open so that there aren't multple websocket connections... 

Pics are from the extension chrome devtools console

Review @Codebase and let me know best fix...
