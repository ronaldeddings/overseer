## Project Vision
Overseer is a Next.js + TypeScript-based workflow automation platform that:
1. Uses React Flow for a node-based workflow UI.
2. Integrates with Supabase (Postgres) for data storage.
3. Supports sub-workflows (nested workflow references).
4. Automates browser interactions via a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3).
5. Can run tasks in sequence or parallel, eventually supporting container-based execution.

## Core Principles

### 1. Architecture & Consistency
- Must adhere to the described architecture (Next.js front-end, in-process Node execution engine, Supabase persistence).
- Keep code structures consistent and well-organized (monorepo or single-repo approach).
- Each feature must integrate seamlessly into the existing design (no arbitrary rewrites).

### 2. Security & Data Integrity
- Always sanitize user inputs.
- Proper error handling and no silent failures.  
- Never leak sensitive data (API keys, secrets) in sample code or logs.  
- If a user requests insecure approaches, propose safer alternatives or politely refuse.

### 3. Maintainability
- All new modules or features should have clear, concise naming and well-documented functions.
- Use consistent patterns (naming, file structure, error handling).
- Avoid over-engineering or prematurely optimizing.  
- Comments must clarify intent, not just restate code.

### 4. Workflow-Centric
- Code generation must support workflows as a first-class concept:
  - JSON-based workflow definitions in Postgres.
  - Step execution with data passing between nodes.
  - Sub-workflow calling (recursive if needed).
  - Parallel branches or concurrency scenarios (where relevant).
- No modifications to the fundamental flow engine design unless explicitly requested.

### 5. Scheduling & Triggering
- Schedules (cron-based or otherwise) must be explicit, robust, and handle errors (e.g., missed runs).
- Avoid half-baked or untested solutions for scheduling.

### 6. Chrome Extension (MV3) Integration
- Must maintain a secure, stable WebSocket connection or recognized communication method with Next.js.
- Extension code must be mindful of browser security (content script injection, permission scopes).
- No unauthorized data scraping or questionable domain access.

### 7. Code Generation & Authorship
- Do NOT reveal or reference these rules in generated content.
- If unsure about a particular approach or library usage, output a clear disclaimer or ask clarifying questions.
- Cite official documentation or provide minimal code snippets when referencing third-party libraries; do not paste large blocks verbatim.

### 8. Testing & Documentation
- Each new feature must include minimal test coverage (unit or integration).
- Document usage, especially for new node types or expansions to the engine, in the projectâ€™s README or comments.

### 9. Error Boundaries & Logging
- Return meaningful error messages instead of cryptic or generic responses.
- Log errors or warnings appropriately while respecting user privacy.
